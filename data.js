    0: "There are undeniable many ongoing costs in a manual pipetting routine which make automated liquid handling a cheaper solution in the long run. flowbot\u00ae ONE, for example, is a proven good return on investment, no matter your application. This is partly because its user-friendly software enables everyone to use it, and the flexible setup can evolve along with any lab. Studies indicate that the risk of developing strain-related injuries significantly increases with manual pipetting for more than 300 hours per year. Although this study is 30 years old, it remains relevant as lab technicians workloads and sample throughputs have likely grown, exacerbating the issue. Reducing strain injuries leads to less employee downtime, which minimizes disruptions to crucial research projects and experiments. This improvement in operational continuity not only speeds up project timelines but also boosts overall lab productivity. Additionally, focusing on strain injury prevention can lower healthcare costs. Investing in lab automation helps mitigate the risk of these injuries, resulting in healthier, more engaged employees. This can lead to higher retention rates and reduced recruitment and training expenses. The long-term financial benefits of a proactive approach to preventing strain injuries in labs extend beyond immediate cost savings, contributing to a more sustainable and thriving research environment. **At Flow Robotics, our pride and joy is liquid handling automation that everyone can use.",
    1: "5 Hidden Costs of Not Automating**\n\nAutomation is well-known for its significant cost savings and high return on investment. Whether you're working with PCR prep, NGS, biobanking, or simple volume transfers like normalization, dilution, cherry-picking, or aliquoting, the hidden costs of not automating can make manual liquid handling a more expensive choice in the long run. This article explores five concrete costs of not automating: **Cost 1: Hands-on Time and Low Throughput** Low throughput is a direct consequence of manual pipetting, especially when facing tight deadlines or customer demands. Lab automation allows labs to handle larger volumes of samples more efficiently. Many customers report that automation enables them to process at least twice the number of samples compared to manual methods, while reducing hands-on time for more valuable tasks. **The PCR Experiment** To illustrate, we conducted an experiment measuring the time saved with flowbot ONE during a standard PCR protocol. Genomic *Escherichia coli* DNA was diluted to various concentrations and master mixes were prepared with different ready mixes. The flowbot ONE assembled the master mixes and transferred them to the PCR plate in 41 minutes and 8 seconds. In contrast, the same manual process took 1 hour and 8 minutes, saving 27 minutes per plate and freeing up time for other tasks. **Cost 2: Strain Injuries and Stress** Manual pipetting can lead to strain injuries and stress, resulting in employee downtime and disruptions to research projects. Automation reduces these risks, enhancing operational continuity and lab productivity. Investing in automation not only helps prevent injuries but also decreases healthcare costs. This results in healthier, more engaged employees, higher retention rates, and reduced recruitment and training expenses. For example, Robert Ertsey, Sr. Manager at Ensigna Biosystems, noted that using the flowbot ONE eliminated daily fatigue and stress, allowing him to focus on more critical tasks. **Cost 3: Reagents and Kits** Maximizing reagent usage is crucial for cost savings, yet manual pipetting can make this difficult. Automation systems like flowbot ONE offer features that minimize reagent waste: **Bottom Touch:** Ensures low dead volume by making the pipette tip touch the bottom of the target vessel after dispensing liquid, preventing liquid from sticking to the tip. **Contact Aspiration:** Allows precise aspiration of small volumes without manual volume calculations, reducing material usage. Numab Therapeutics, for example, reported that flowbot ONE doubled their data yield while using only a fifth of the material required for manual pipetting. **Cost 4: Low Accuracy and Poor Reproducibility** Automated liquid handlers like flowbot ONE provide unparalleled precision and accuracy, enhancing data quality and reproducibility. This fosters a culture of trust in data-driven decision-making. For Numab Therapeutics, the flowbot ONE's ability to handle highly viscous PEG solutions was crucial for high data quality, enabling more efficient screening and cost savings through accurate, reproducible results. **Cost 5: Human Errors** Manual pipetting introduces a high risk of human errors, which can account for up to 70 percent of mistakes in lab diagnostics. Common errors include inconsistent pipetting, incorrect volume measurement, contamination, and sample switching. Automation reduces the likelihood of these errors, minimizing the need for costly re-testing or redo experiments.",
