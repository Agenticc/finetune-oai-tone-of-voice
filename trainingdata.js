*   Pro tip ðŸ’› use this prompt to have AI format the raw text for you:
*   
*   You will receive multiple text snippets of varying lengths.   
*   Your task is to combine these snippets into a single, properly formatted (valid) text string enclosed in double quotation marks (").
*   Remove all formatting, such as markdown, and separate each line with \n. 
*   If there are any quotation marks within the provided text, e.g. in quotes, ensure they are correctly formatted with single quotes (') to maintain a valid final string.
